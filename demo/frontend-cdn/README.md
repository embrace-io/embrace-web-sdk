This projects is a copy of the demo/frontend project. The only difference is the web-sdk being imported as a script in
`index.html`, demoing how the sdk will work imported from a cdn, instead of as an npm dependency.

See [demo/frontend](../frontend/README.md) for more information on how to run the demo.
